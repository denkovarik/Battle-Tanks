Refactor Code to make tank more modularized
    Create following classes following TTD (Unit testing must be completed on
    the following classes before it can be integrated into the tank).
	SituationalAwarness
	    -scans map and identifies threats
		-if threat is identified, then neural network should determine
		 if the tank should fight or flee
		-This might mean separate classes for fighting and fleeing would
		 be needed, but not sure yet.
	CanHit
	    -Once a threat has been identified, then this class will determine if
	     tank can hit a tank in sight
	Move
	    -Determines destination to move to
	    -Finds a path to the destination
	    -If destination is unreachable, then mark it as obsticle/unreachable
