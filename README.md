## Battle Tanks

# Description
Welcome to Battle-Tanks. This repo has been adapted from the CSC 340 course 
project at The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology for educational 
purposes. In this repo, there is a project called "projectx". This is a 
platform that supports multiple tanks battling each other on a field. 
Developers can write and program tanks to play on this field. In addition, 
the Squad7++ directory contains a tank, called Edelweiss, written to run on 
the projectx platform for the course described above.
