# Battle Tanks

## Description
Welcome to Battle-Tanks. This repo has been adapted from the CSC 340 
Indroduction to Software Engineering course 
project at The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology for educational 
purposes. In this repo, there is a project called "projectx". This is a 
platform that supports multiple tanks battling each other on a field. 
Developers can write and program tanks to play on this field. In addition, 
the Squad7++ directory contains a tank, called Edelweiss, written to run on 
the projectx platform for the course described above.
